For our Capstone project, we will create a digital journaling application, providing users with a secure & customizable journal that supports features such as password protection, font choices, paper styles, and light/dark mode. Future scalability will also be included, with the potential to display a whiteboard feature. 
If there is enough time, a web app will also be developed, as an enhancement, to provide an interactive interface for users to engage with the project's functionality. If not, the project will focus on completing the necessary features without including the web app component.

WRSPM Analysis

World Assumptions: Assume that users are searching for a digital journal app that can balance functionality and convenience, with digital tools growing rapidly.

User Requirements: Journal entries will have password protection and encryption. The application will provide several customization options, such as different fonts, paper styles, and light/dark mode themes.

Specifications & Interface Needs: The application will use JavaFx for the UI, with FXML & SceneBuilder helping with a responsive design. The database will manage user accounts and journal entries securely.

Program & Hardware: Development will consist of IntelliJ, with JavaFx and SceneBuilder for application design. The final version pre-deployment will need testing on both macOS & Windows.
